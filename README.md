# Project 3: Graduation Rates Across American Universities

### Group Members: Juhi, Kesha, Lora, and Hima

In this project, our group focused on describing the state of American universities and their student profiles in 2013 based a dataset from Kaggle. We used this dataset to develop a map using Leaflet and a dashboard using JavaScript/HTML. Our map displays the US map with pins locating different universities. When you select each pin, the name, graduation rate, and total enrollment of the university will populate. Our dashboard includes a dropdown menu to select for a specific university, which will result in a metadata panel being displayed with the following information the graduation rate for attaining a Bachelor's degree in 4 years, 5 years, and 6 years. A bar chart with the 25th percentile and 75th percentile SAT scores in critical reading, math, and writing will be displayed on our dashboard. Additionally, a line graph with tuition and fees from 2010-2014 will also be displayed depending on the university selected.
