# Project 3: Graduation Rates Across American Universities

### Group Members: Juhi, Kesha, Lora, and Hima

In this project, our group used 2013 graduation data from American universities to develop a HTML dashboard. Our dashboard includes the US map with pins locating different universities. When you select each pin, the name, graduation rate and total enrollment of the university will populate. Our dashboard will also include a dropdown menu to select for a specific state, which will result in a table being displayed with the following information: name(s) of the university, graduation rate(s), and the average SAT and ACT scores of admitted students. The last visualization included in our dashboard is a pie chart displaying the percentage of Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral graduates in the United States in 2013.
