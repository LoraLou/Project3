The dashboard includes a map with markers for each University studied and the graduation rate at each university. A drop-down menu is also shown on the dashboard and with a list of the universities and the average SAT and ACT scores. The third visualization included in the dashboard is a pie chart with the total number of Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral graduates.
